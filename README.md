# Pacman
This is a game that I made in 8th grade as part of a project. I think this goes to show how much better you can get at coding in just a years time :) (just look at how sloppy the code and organization is)

I'm not going to edit this repo at all, because I don't use pygame anymore, as I don't think it is the best for game development. But, feel free to take a look at it and clone and edit this repo if you want.
